# Desktop-Cover

***

A PECMD script for covering the computer desktop, designed to work in conjunction with Sordum's software [KeyFreeze](https://www.sordum.org/7921/bluelife-keyfreeze-v1-4-block-keyboard-and-mouse/).

`KeyFreeze` is a useful app that allows you to lock the keyboard and mouse when you need to step away from your computer for a short period without putting it to sleep. However, there are times when you don't want others to peek at your screen. `Desktop-Cover` was created for just such occasions.

Use `Ctrl+Shift+L` to toggle whether the desktop is covered. Of course, you can also customize the shortcut key by modifying `SCRIPT\101:2052` with `ResourceHacker`.

To set the software to start automatically on boot, press `Win+R` and type `shell:startup`, then copy the shortcut of the software into the folder that appears.
